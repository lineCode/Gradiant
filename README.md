# Gradiant
Gradiant is a desktop application tool I created to learn Qt, a C++ graphics framework, which was used heavily during my co-op at L-3 Communications.

It analyzes a student's current standing in a class and gives them feedback regarding what scores they need for certain letter grades.

Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
  
    `$ git clone https://github.com/steerzac/Gradiant.git`

2. Open the .dmg
  
    `$ open Gradiant.dmg`

3. Click on the application.

4. Fill in your class info and hopefully receive positive feedback.
